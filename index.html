<h2>Writing Reflection II</h2>

<h3>Within my work, I feel proud of what I create. I recently looked back at work before art school and I was still proud of the work I had made at the time, even though back then I wasn’t sure of what I was creating. I have anxiety surrounding my work, but my purpose in life I feel is to bend over backwards on the work I enjoy, creating the full extent of what I envision. When I finish a work, I feel proud and fulfilled, but I have realized that my work is never really “finished”, I can always build on top of it in a new way, recycle work into new work, or something along those lines. I recently created old prints from photo last semester into new paper, without pictures shown. I enjoy working like this, to create new metaphor and new levels of meaning in my work. If I can’t finish a work within a day, it becomes all I think about, it consumes my life, and I can’t think about other projects in the same field until I complete that one. My personal philosophies in my work are extensive, mostly pointing back to personal peace. My work is for me to make sense of my life, to make sense of a family I never saw together, and to make sense of what and why I was put through what I was subjected to. My practice has allowed me to forgive and find mental peace in myself. I believe to be an artist is how you view the world, and how you recreate your world the way that makes sense to you. </h3>
